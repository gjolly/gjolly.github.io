But there is a flow.\nThe flow In order to decrypt the root filesystem, the kernel uses a initial ram disk (initramfs). The initramfs provides an temporary filesystem from which extra kernel modules can be loaded, it also contains a set of scripts used to boot the system including scripts to decrypt the user\u0026rsquo;s root filesystem. This initramfs image is a file stored un-encrypted next to the kernel image. However, unlike the kernel image, it is not signed by the kernel publisher as the iniramfs is generated locally and can be modified by the user. Thus, anyone with physical access to the user\u0026rsquo;s drive can inject a malicious initramfs that would log the user\u0026rsquo;s passphrase and thus make FDE useless.\nHow to fix it We can bundle the kernel and initramfs together in a single binary and sign this binary locally. Thus, modifying the initramfs would prevent the system from booting.\nIn practice On systems using mkinitcpio or dracut see this article: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_kernel_image#Preparing_a_unified_kernel_image.\nOn Ubuntu To create the unified EFI binary:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:snappy-dev/image sudo apt-get -y install ubuntu-core-initramfs sudo ubuntu-core-initramfs create-efi --unsigned --output \u0026#34;kernel.efi.unsigned\u0026#34; \\ --cmdline \u0026#34;$(cut -f 2- -d\u0026#39; \u0026#39; /proc/cmdline)\u0026#34; \\ --kernel \u0026#34;/boot/vmlinuz\u0026#34; \\ --kernelver \u0026#34;$(uname -r)\u0026#34; \\ --initrd \u0026#34;/boot/initrd.img\u0026#34; Create and enroll a new MOK:\n# You can let everything as default, or customize the fields, it doesn\u0026#39;t matter openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \\ -nodes -days 36500 -outform DER \\ -keyout \u0026#34;MOK.priv\u0026#34; \\ -out \u0026#34;MOK.der\u0026#34; openssl x509 -in MOK.der -inform DER -outform PEM -out MOK.pem sudo mokutil --import MOK.der Restart your system and follow the instructions to enroll the key.\nSign the Kernel EFI:\nsudo sbsign --key MOK.priv --cert MOK.pem kernel.efi.unsigned --output kernel.efi Move it do the ESP (or to the /boot partition), example:\nsudo mv kernel.efi /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu Add a new boot entry to boot on this kernel, example (make sure to point change --disk and --part to your ESP):\nsudo efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/vda --part 15 --label \u0026#39;Ubuntu 5.15.0-52-generic\u0026#39; --loader \u0026#34;\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\u0026#34; -u \u0026#34;\\EFI\\ubuntu\\kernel.efi\u0026#34; Limitations/Next What will happen when a new kernel will be released? With this example, we would stay blocked on the old kernel. To make it production ready, we need to automated those steps to run them everytime a new kernel is installed.\n"},{"ref":"/blog/grub_less/","title":"Boot Linux without GRUB","section":"blog","tags":["Linux","Kernel","Boot"],"date":"2021.11.19","body":"Boot Linux without GRUB To boot the Linux Kernel, most distro use a bootloader and one of the most popular is GRUB. But did you know you can directly boot the Kernel without using a bootloader?\nDISCLAIMER: This is only for fun and learning, I do not advise anyone to do that on their main system. Be safe, use a VM.\nVM setup Just a quick recap of what is needed (mostely stolen from powersj\u0026rsquo;s excelent blog post).\nSetup the user-data (for cloud-init) to be able to SSH into the VM:\ncat \u0026gt; user-data.yaml \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF #cloud-config ssh_authorized_keys: - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwJJJQEA3I7VUf3l5gSn5uavROsc5HRDpZ ... ssh_import_id: - gh:\u0026lt;github user\u0026gt; - lp:\u0026lt;launchpad user\u0026gt; EOF # cloud-localds is shipped in [cloud image utils](cloud-image-utils) cloud-localds seed.img user-data.yaml Copy the EFI vars to a temp place (they will get modified)\ncp /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd /tmp/ Download an Ubuntu cloud-image and launch the VM with the cloud-init metadata and the EFI firemware.\ncurl -O http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/21.10/release/ubuntu-21.10-server-cloudimg-amd64.img qemu-system-x86_64 \\ -nographic \\ -cpu host \\ -enable-kvm \\ -smp 4 \\ -m 4G \\ -drive if=virtio,format=qcow2,file=ubuntu-21.10-server-cloudimg-amd64.img \\ -drive if=virtio,format=raw,file=./seed.img \\ -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 --netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \\ -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \\ -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=/tmp/OVMF_VARS.fd To SSH into the VM: ssh ubuntu@0.0.0.0 -p 2222\nIn practice First, check if your Kernel config allows this:\n$ cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) [|](|) grep EFI_STUB CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y Then, copy the Kernel and initrd to the EFI partition:\ncp -v /boot/initrd.img-* /boot/efi/EFI/ cp -v /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) /boot/efi/EFI/vmlinuz-$(uname -r).efi In theory, you can put those files wherever you want on the EFI partition (Ubuntu uses /EFI/ubuntu for example). Just be carefull about the length of the EFI stub path, see this thread.\nNow we need to find out some information about the system:\nOn which device (and partition) is located the root filesystem? On which device and which partition is the EFI partition? Example:\n$ lsblk -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL NAME MOUNTPOINT LABEL fd0 loop0 /snap/core20/1169 loop1 /snap/lxd/21780 loop2 /snap/snapd/13640 sr0 vda ├─vda1 / cloudimg-rootfs ├─vda14 └─vda15 /boot/efi UEFI vdb cidata On this system, the root filesystem is in /dev/vda1 and the EFI partition is on the same device /dev/vda on partition number 15.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s add a new boot entry in the UEFI boot manager\nefibootmgr --create --disk /dev/vda --part 15 --label grub-less --loader \u0026#34;\\EFI\\vmlinuz-$(uname -r).efi\u0026#34; -u \u0026#34;root=/dev/vda1 initrd=\\\\EFI\\\\initrd.img-$(uname -r) ro console=ttyS0\u0026#34; efibootmgr is a CLI tool to manipulate the UEFI boot manager (no one could have guessed it :D) --create indicates we want to create a new boot entry --disk specifies the disk containing the bootloader (here the Kernel) --part is the partition where the boot loader (here the Kernel) is --label is simply the name we want to give to this new boot entry --loader is the actual bootloader we want to call, here it is the Kernel we previously copied -u is used to pass arguments to the boot loader. Here we pass the location of initrd and the other usual Kernel command line arguments (check /proc/cmdline to find out which cmdline arguments are currently in use) The current boot entries can then be checked with: efibootmgr (no arg). The new boot entry we just created should already be the first one in the bootorder list.\nReboot!! The system should start directly without going through the GRUB.\nAt the very beginning of the serial console, we can find:\nBdsDxe: loading Boot0008 \u0026#34;grub-less\u0026#34; from HD(15,GPT,CB5D0560-825B-4575-A9E3-F3263C410054,0x2800,0x35000)/\\EFI\\vmlinuz-5.13.0-20-generic.efi BdsDxe: starting Boot0008 \u0026#34;grub-less\u0026#34; from HD(15,GPT,CB5D0560-825B-4575-A9E3-F3263C410054,0x2800,0x35000)/\\EFI\\vmlinuz-5.13.0-20-generic.efi EFI stub: Loaded initrd from command line option Troubleshooting If something goes really wrong and the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t boot, use this post to mount the EFI partition locally and simply delete the Kernel\u0026rsquo;s EFI from it.
